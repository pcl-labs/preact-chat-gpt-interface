## üß© Why Preact?

This clone achieves a **full ChatGPT experience in just ~40KB** (gzipped) by using Preact instead of React:

- **Dramatically Smaller**: The entire app is smaller than React alone
- **Faster Load Times**: ~40KB total vs 100-300KB for typical React apps
- **API Compatibility**: Same API as React, making migration seamless
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Less JS means faster load times on mobile networks
- **Lower Memory Usage**: Requires less RAM to run smoothly
- **Same Modern Features**: Hooks, Context, etc. without the overhead

## üîå Embedding & Integration

The chat interface can be embedded in any website with two display options:

### Positioning Options

1. **Widget Mode** (default) - Appears as a collapsible chat widget in the bottom-right corner
   - High-contrast toggle button for easy access
   - Full-height sidebar when expanded
   - Automatically collapses on mobile devices for better UX

2. **Inline Mode** - Embeds directly within a page as a regular component
   - Always visible (no collapse/expand functionality)
   - Ideal for dedicated chat pages

### URL Parameters

Control behavior using URL parameters:

- `?position=widget` - Display as a collapsible widget (default)
- `?position=inline` - Display as an inline component
- `?teamId=YOUR_TEAM_ID` - Connect to a specific team context
- `?apiUrl=YOUR_API_URL` - (Optional) Override the default API endpoint for chat messages

Example:
```
https://chat.blawby.com/?position=widget&teamId=acme-corp&apiUrl=https://compass-ts.paulchrisluke.workers.dev/query
```

If `apiUrl` is not provided, the chat UI will use the default endpoint:

```
https://compass-ts.paulchrisluke.workers.dev/query
```
